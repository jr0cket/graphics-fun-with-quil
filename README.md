# graphics-fun-with-quil

This code was created as part of the London Clojurians coding dojo on 24th April 2012, by team 2.

The purpose of this code is to discover how to use the Clojure wrapper around the Java Processing libraires called Quil.



## Usage

If you have been using Leiningen already, you know what to do...

Otherwise, install leiningen (preferably version 2, although this project should work with version 1.7.x).

From the top level project directory, run 

lein repl

Sit back and what the stunning visuals.
